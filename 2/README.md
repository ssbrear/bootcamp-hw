This project is intended to be a responsive portfolio for my work. I have not created any major projects through this bootcamp yet, but I plan to feature them on this page in the future. For now, I have included a side project I created in Unity sometime last year, as well as a link to a fan page I created for the pre-work.

This porfolio is responsive, in that it dynamically reacts to the width of the page. The biggest example of this is the header, which is featured at the top on each page. As for the content of each page, the contact page's content was almost entirely indifferent to the width of the page, so the responsiveness can only be seen on the About Me and Portfolio pages.
