                My name is Sebastian Brear, and I'm currently attending UC Davis and progressing towards a BS in Electrical Engineering. 
                I actually don't really have that huge of an interest in my field of study, and see it primarily as a means to an end in getting a well-playing job. 
                <br> <br>
                If I were to list my favourite subjects, they would be: History, Philosophy and Politics to name a few. Despite being infinitely more passionate about these 
                disciplines, I know that I would not be dedicated enough to study them at a university. I've never done well in a classroom setting, always finding it difficult to focus during lecture. 
                Despite this, I can very easily sit down and listen to a several hour long video on any of these topics without a problem, which is typically how I consume a majority of my entertainment.
                <br> <br>
                After graduating, my girlfriend and I are looking to move to Europe, preferably Sweden or some other country in the north (we love the cold!). My dream career would be in the video game industry,
                 as games have always been something I have been passionate about.
