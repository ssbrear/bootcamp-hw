-----MY README-----
This project is a code quiz that asks some basic questions about programming languages and basic aspects of web development.

The score is determined both by how long it takes for the user to answer all of the questions, and how correct the user was.
(Each wrong question is worth 10 seconds).

At the end of the quiz, the user inputs their initials and submits them to local storage.
If the page is loaded at a later time on the same computer, the high score should remain.
